# Kaggle Getting Started Prediction Competition
## [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/): Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

### What is this code for

The goal of the code is to search for the best macroparameters for this task.

### How to use

I don't provide `requirements.txt` to one should use the versions used in his or her Kaggle notebook.
1. Run the code several times as see in which direction which macroparameters should be changed.
2. Change the parameters in notebook and try several coomits with slightly different macroparameters and different seed (to cope overlearning on train dataset).

### My final leaderscore

At the time I write this (2023, August 28) [my best score](https://www.kaggle.com/alekseizabirnik/hp-with-ols-and-macroparams-optimization) is $0.11943$ which is top-110. Taking into account that scores below $0.11529$ which is top-65 are 'data leak scores' (becacuse the next score is $0.10006$ my honest leaderboard position is $110 - 64 = 46$ out of more then $4000$ participants. That is for this competition I hit top $1.2$% target.
